Title: Protocol Description for IVM SOC V2

The UART on the SOC V2 supports the ability to send data and ASCII characters. For verbosity and due to lack of DMA ability in V2, 
we have designed a simple single ASCII character based Protocol, that allows us to understand the information that is coming in via 
the UART Monitor from the SOC. 
This is a Work In Progress, and we will update the protocol as we test more and more complex use cases. 

Here's a listing of the symbols, and their explanations. (As of 02/09/2026)
> : Boot up Complete (From SOC)
? : Program time-out, while waiting for User Input.
P : Passed Software Self test. 
F : Failed Software Self test. 
S	: Start 		(Given from User/UART/TB)
C	: Complete 	(Given from SOC)
D#: Following # bytes are to be treated as raw Hex. Used to dump results. (Given from SOC)
R : The next hex dump will give "Non-NOP Instructions Retired". 
Y : The next hex dump will give "Number of Core Cycles".
